## Some script to create High Dynamic Range pictures

These are [GNU Octave scripts](https://octave.org/) to to create High Dynamic Range picture. GNU Octave is a programming platform / langage for scientific computing, it can be used whatever your prefered OS.

Just drop some images taken at different exposures with ot without colors filters (like with AEB mode in Photo!, but game Boy Camera, with a tripod can perform this too) in the dedicated folders, run the dedicated scripts and enjoy your enhanced image !

You can also upload your images to the [GBCamera Android Manager](https://github.com/Mraulio/GBCamera-Android-Manager) or use the [Python HDR image processing tool](https://github.com/seb-tourneux/gbcam-hdr-utils) and apply the exact same process.
